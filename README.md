# CISC275-Lab1
Hello! For this lab, we want to delve into the workflow of GitHub. Last week, you had an assignment revolving around Git, so let's get into GitHub this week. This assignment should be super easy if you already have GitHub workflow experience. If you don't have much experience using GitHub, that's also fine! That's why we're doing this lab. 

Some of this may be repetitive from last week, but if anything, more practice will help you get used to using Git & GitHub now as opposed to later. 

As a general overview for this lab, we will:

Fork a repository
Invite collaborators to your repository
Create and modify a branch (So, task 2 again) 
Check the status of a repository
Make, stage, and commit changes to a repository
Push changes to the remote repository
Pull upstream changes into your local repository
Merge changes into master through a pull request
Resolve merge conflicts (if necessary)
 

How will this lab be graded? 

Steps 1-3: 33% - 
This will be checked through the repo URL you submit. For this part, we will be looking that the link of the repo you provide is a fork of the provided one in the assignment, your lab TA has been invited to collaborate with your repository, and you have a feature branch that has been modified. 
Steps 4-6: 33% - 
This will be graded by sending a screenshot of your terminal (either cmd, git, or VScode terminal, whichever you prefer). With the result of the git status, after you make changes, you stage and commit changes and push it to remote. This may need multiple screenshots, but that's ok. 
Steps 7-9: 33% -
We will check this by seeing the stuff you pull from upstream AFTER you push to remote and us seeing a successful pull request in your repo. The only change we, as TAs, will make will be in the readme.md file. 
Submitting on time: 1% -
Hey! As long as you submit this on time, you get AT LEAST a .1/10 :)
 

Resources you need for this assignment:

The starting repository you need to fork:
(Making this now, link will be in once it's done)
How to do each of the steps:
(Link docs, will find this in a second)
What you need to submit:

A link to your GitHub Repository
Screenshots of your terminal for steps 4-6. 
 

If you don't finish this during your scheduled lab time, that's ok! But we encourage you to make your best attempt to get it done during lab time so we can guarantee you get help if you need it when you need it. If you have any questions about the wording of this lab, please email dmesser@udel.edu or ping him on the Discord channel #275-labs, as he could have made a typo or forgot to add a word in the directions.
